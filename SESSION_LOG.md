## Session 6 — 2026-03-28 — Real Extraction Pipeline, UI Overhaul, Git Setup

**Who:** Claude Code
**Duration:** ~30 minutes

### What was done:

#### Gemini Extraction — Fixed & Verified End-to-End
- [x] Fixed `_call_gemini()` — was creating `genai.Client()` without API key, causing silent failures
- [x] Relaxed Phase C type filtering — if ontology generation fails, accepts all Gemini-extracted types instead of dropping everything
- [x] Cleared garbage data from Neo4j (had 5 nodes with names like "window", "sendEvent" from corrupted JS globals)
- [x] Verified full pipeline: text → Gemini 2.5 Flash → 13 entities + 11 relationships → stored in Neo4j
- [x] Real entity types: Person, Theory, Organization, Year, City, Country, Award, etc.

#### Full UI Color Palette Overhaul
- [x] Background: `#0b1326` (navy blue) → `#09090b` (near-black) — graph edges/arrows now visible
- [x] Glass panels: opaque navy → `rgba(24,24,27,0.82)` with zinc borders — clear contrast against background
- [x] Text hierarchy: zinc scale (#fafafa primary, #a1a1aa secondary, #71717a muted)
- [x] Accent: #f59e0b (amber), secondary: #34d399 (emerald)
- [x] Added 6 new entity type colors: Field, Method, Model, Architecture, Theory, Date
- [x] Graph theme updated: near-black canvas, visible edge/arrow colors (zinc-400 at 25%)

#### Component Fixes (All Panels)
- [x] LeftPanel — proper padding, stat cards with bg containers, clean entity type list
- [x] IngestionPanel — segmented control style, proper textarea, amber button, status badges with colored backgrounds
- [x] VoicePanel — cleaner pill design, proper text hierarchy, amber mic button
- [x] InfoSidebar — property cards with backgrounds, relationship buttons with borders
- [x] ThoughtStream — consistent spacing, proper dividers
- [x] Removed vignette overlay and ambient glow from App.tsx (caused muddy look)

#### Billing Cleanup
- [x] User unlinked billing from 3 old GCP projects (authentic-scout, gcloud-hackathon-3xf, gen-lang-client)
- [ ] vibrant-resource-8b2bd — permission denied, may need project owner

### Key decisions:
1. Near-black (#09090b) instead of navy blue — graph visualization needs dark neutral background, not colored
2. Zinc color scale for text/borders — industry standard for dark UIs (matches Vercel, Linear, etc.)
3. Phase C extraction is forgiving — if ontology parsing fails, keeps all entities instead of filtering to empty set

### Verified working:
- Real Gemini extraction: 13 nodes + 11 edges from Einstein paragraph
- Neo4j connected and persisting data
- Frontend builds clean (0 TS errors)
- Backend health check: `{"status":"ok","neo4j_connected":true}`

### Open items:
- [ ] Verify UI visually with user
- [ ] Test voice conversation with Gemini Live
- [ ] Push to GitHub for team access
- [ ] Build Canvas (V1.1)
- [ ] Cloud Run deployment
- [ ] Wire ADK agent to real queries (currently mock thinking animation)
- [ ] Ontology view panel

## Session 4 — 2026-03-28 — Voice Integration, Ingestion Pipeline, Frontend Features

**Who:** Claude Code (autonomous build session)
**Duration:** ~30 minutes (4 parallel agents)

### What was built:

#### Voice Integration (Frontend)
- [x] `useAudioCapture.ts` — Mic capture hook: getUserMedia → ScriptProcessorNode → 16-bit PCM 16kHz → base64 → WebSocket
- [x] `useAudioPlayback.ts` — Audio playback hook: base64 PCM 24kHz → AudioBufferSourceNode with seamless chaining
- [x] `VoicePanel.tsx` rewritten — Real mic recording, live canvas waveform from AnalyserNode, pulsing ring animation, connection status dot
- [x] `useWebSocket.ts` updated — Routes audio_chunk events to playback callback

#### Voice Integration (Backend)
- [x] `voice/session.py` — VoiceSession class managing Gemini Live API (gemini-2.0-flash-live-001), bidirectional audio streaming, function calling mid-conversation
- [x] `voice/tool_declarations.py` — 6 Gemini FunctionDeclarations (search_concepts, explore_entity, find_path, get_graph_stats, highlight_nodes, add_node)
- [x] `voice/tool_executor.py` — Maps Gemini function calls to actual Python tool functions, executes and returns results
- [x] `main.py` WebSocket handler updated — start_voice/audio_chunk/stop_voice event handling, voice session lifecycle

#### Ingestion System (Backend)
- [x] `ingestion/job_manager.py` — In-memory job tracker with status progression (started → parsing → extracting_phase_a/b/c → storing → complete)
- [x] `ingestion/ingest.py` — Full async ingestion flow: parse → chunk → Phase A/B/C extraction → Neo4j storage → WebSocket broadcasts
- [x] `POST /api/ingest` endpoint — Accepts text/URL/YouTube/PDF, kicks off background task, returns job_id
- [x] `GET /api/ingest/{job_id}` endpoint — Returns job status with progress
- [x] `ingest_tools.py` rewritten — Real implementation replacing stub, calls run_ingestion via asyncio

#### Frontend Features
- [x] Node click handling — onNodeClick in GraphView → selectNode in graphStore
- [x] InfoSidebar redesigned — Shows node details (type badge, properties table, relationships) or graph stats
- [x] `ingestionStore.ts` — Zustand store for ingestion progress tracking
- [x] `IngestionPanel.tsx` — Text/URL/YouTube input, PDF upload, live progress display
- [x] `LeftPanel.tsx` — Left sidebar with graph stats, entity type breakdown, embedded ingestion panel
- [x] App.tsx layout updated — Three-column: LeftPanel (w-64) | Graph (flex-1) | InfoSidebar (w-80)

### Build verification:
- Frontend: `pnpm build` passes clean (0 TypeScript errors)
- Backend: All modules import successfully
- No new npm dependencies added (Web Audio API is browser-native)

### Key decisions:
1. **Gemini Live model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` (the live-capable model)
2. **Audio format**: Frontend sends PCM16 16kHz, receives PCM 24kHz (Gemini Live's native formats)
3. **Ingestion background tasks**: REST uses FastAPI BackgroundTasks, WebSocket uses asyncio.create_task, ADK tool uses asyncio.ensure_future
4. **Progress mapping**: Phase A = 15-40%, Phase B = 45-55%, Phase C = 60-85%, storing = 88%, complete = 100%

### Open items for next session:
- [ ] User verification of all new features (run backend + frontend together)
- [ ] Apply Stitch design system when designs arrive
- [ ] End-to-end voice test with real Gemini API key
- [ ] End-to-end ingestion test (text → extraction → Neo4j → graph update)
- [ ] Canvas implementation (V1.1 — JSON component renderer)
- [ ] Cloud Run deployment setup
- [ ] ThoughtStream as standalone floating component
- [ ] Ontology view panel

## Session 2 — 2026-03-28 — PRD v2: Deep Pipeline, Agentic Querying, Thinking UI

**Who:** [Your Name] + Claude Code
**Duration:** ~3 hours

### What was done:
- [x] Deep research: Neo4j LLM Graph Builder, neo4j-graphrag library, agentic GraphRAG, CSV auto-detection, ontology voice editing, TrustGraph thinking UI
- [x] Mapped reusable components from 3 open-source repos (neo4j-graphrag-python, trustgraph, llm-graph-builder)
- [x] Rewrote PRD to v2 with major upgrades:
  - Replaced custom extraction with `neo4j-graphrag` library as engine
  - Added full 3-phase pipeline spec (Discovery → Ontology Gen → Precision Extraction)
  - Added TrustGraph-inspired ontology subsetting (vector-embed OWL classes → find relevant subset per chunk)
  - Added agentic GraphRAG with 8 specialized query tools (not basic semantic search)
  - Added CSV → auto-detection pipeline (statistical profiling → heuristic → Gemini → auto-import)
  - Added voice-controlled ontology editing (OntologyAgent with 13 function tools + rdflib)
  - Added "Thinking Through the Graph" animation system (sequential path glow + ripple expansion + thought stream overlay)
- [x] Confirmed TrustGraph is too heavy to run directly ($180-250/mo, 12GB RAM, 34 services)
- [x] Confirmed TrustGraph's "thinking" UI is just text badges (🧠👁✅), NOT animated graph — our version is a unique innovation

### Key decisions:
1. **`neo4j-graphrag[google]`** as the extraction engine — official Neo4j library, handles chunking/extraction/dedup/writing, supports Gemini via VertexAILLM
2. **Steal patterns, not code** from TrustGraph — ontology subsetting algorithm, provenance tracking, agent query patterns
3. **Pre-built Cypher templates** for common queries (explore, path, stats) — Text2Cypher only for complex unexpected questions
4. **rdflib** for ontology management (no Java dependency, Turtle format, lightweight)
5. **3 animation modes combined** for thinking UI — sequential path glow + ripple expansion + thought stream overlay
6. **CSV auto-detection** back in scope — 3-stage pipeline (heuristic → Gemini → auto-import)
7. **Voice ontology editing** back in scope — OntologyAgent with voice commands

### Architecture changes from v1:
- Added CSVAnalysisAgent as 5th sub-agent
- Added OntologyView as new frontend panel
- Added ThoughtStream as new frontend component
- Added `useThinkingAnimation.ts` hook
- Added `ontology_subsetter.py` for TrustGraph pattern
- Phase 3 expanded from Days 8-10 to Days 8-11 (more animation work)
- WebSocket protocol expanded with 6 new `thinking_*` event types

### Open items for next session:
- [ ] Share design inspiration images for UI aesthetic
- [ ] Set up Neo4j AuraDB Free instance
- [ ] Initialize frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind + Reagraph
- [ ] Initialize backend with FastAPI + ADK + neo4j-graphrag
- [ ] Get basic WebSocket connection working
- [ ] Start Phase 1 tasks

## Session 1 — 2026-03-28 — Initial Setup & PRD

**Who:** [Your Name] + Claude Code
**Duration:** ~2 hours

### What was done:
- [x] Created technical PRD with full architecture, tech stack, execution plan
- [x] Researched: Gemini Live API, Google ADK, graph databases, visualization libraries, TrustGraph
- [x] Decided on tech stack:
  - Voice: Gemini Live (Multimodal Live API)
  - Agents: Google ADK (Python)
  - Graph DB: Neo4j AuraDB Free
  - Visualization: Reagraph (React, 3D)
  - Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
  - Backend: Python FastAPI + WebSocket
  - Extraction: Custom Gemini-powered ontology-guided pipeline (TrustGraph-inspired)
  - Deploy: Google Cloud Run
- [x] Set up repo folder structure
- [x] Created SESSION_LOG.md for collaboration tracking

### Key decisions:
1. **Neo4j AuraDB Free** over self-hosted options — zero cost, instant setup, 200K node limit is plenty
2. **Reagraph** over Cytoscape/Cosmograph — most React-native, built-in highlighting, modern 3D aesthetic
3. **TrustGraph-inspired custom extraction** — borrow ontology-guided approach but build with Gemini directly
4. **ADK + function calling hybrid** — ADK for orchestration, function calling for low-latency graph ops in Live sessions
5. **TrustGraph rejected for direct use** — too heavy (34+ microservices, 12GB RAM, $180-250/mo GKE) for hackathon

### Open items for next session:
- [ ] Set up Neo4j AuraDB Free instance
- [ ] Initialize frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind + Reagraph
- [ ] Initialize backend with FastAPI + ADK
- [ ] Get basic WebSocket connection working
- [ ] Create shared TypeScript/Python event types

## Session 5 — 2026-03-28 — API Keys, Animation Fix, ThoughtStream, Model Updates

**Who:** Claude Code
**Duration:** ~20 minutes

### What was done:
- [x] Set up `.env` with Gemini API key and Neo4j AuraDB credentials
- [x] Verified Gemini API works (model: `gemini-2.5-flash` for generation)
- [x] Verified Neo4j AuraDB connected (`neo4j_connected: true`)
- [x] Fixed Gemini Live model: `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` → `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview`
- [x] Fixed thinking animation: 5x slower (~8-10s), uses real graph data, active nodes turn WHITE
- [x] Built ThoughtStream floating panel (bottom-right, streaming reasoning steps with fade animation)
- [x] Removed inline thinking overlay from GraphView (replaced by ThoughtStream)
- [x] Fixed ingestion endpoint: split into `/api/ingest` (JSON) and `/api/ingest/file` (multipart)
- [x] Fixed React StrictMode double-mount causing WebSocket disconnect
- [x] Improved glass panel styling (opaque dark + inner highlight, not relying on backdrop-filter)

### Key decisions:
1. `gemini-2.5-flash` for text generation/extraction (works)
2. `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` for voice (only available live model)
3. Glass panels use opaque dark backgrounds (backdrop-filter doesn't work on WebGL canvases)

### Credentials configured:
- Gemini API: `gcloud-hackathon-fodxwx9b7vwkg` project
- Neo4j AuraDB: `b5b8bf80.databases.neo4j.io` (Free tier)
- GCP billing: linked to Trial Billing Account

### Open items:
- [ ] Verify animation visually
- [ ] Test voice conversation with real Gemini Live
- [ ] Test real extraction (not mock) with Gemini
- [ ] Check old GCP projects for unwanted charges
- [ ] Canvas (V1.1)
- [ ] Cloud Run deployment
